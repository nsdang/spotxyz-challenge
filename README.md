# Spot.xyz Takehome Challenges

**NOTE: PLEASE DO NOT FORK THIS REPO**

_Instead, create an entirely separate **private** github repository with the contents of the subfolder corresponding to the challenge you intend to complete. We will be sharing this repo with multiple candidates and all forks and PRs will be visible._

## Overview

This takehome project is intended to give candidates a sample of the types of problems they might be solving working at spot.xyz. It is also useful for us to evaluate candidates on the following dimensions:

- Creativity and general problem solving ability
- Ability to quickly learn new technologies
- Attention to detail and code hygiene
- Ability to work independently
- Existing proficiency writing javascript/typescript code (or ability to pick it up quickly)

## Getting Started

This repository contains multiple challenges. Candidates are only asked to complete a single challenge for consideration. There are currently two challenges located in their respective sub-folders. Please pick one and read their corresponding `README.md`.

## Submitting the Completed Challenge

Please create an entirely separate **private** repository (not a fork) in GitHub containing the full source code of the challenge and the solution. Share this repo in github with usernames `ghempton` and `whather` and drop us an email at `apply@spot.xyz` with a link to the repository.
